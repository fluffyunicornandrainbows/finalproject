			<h5 class="card-title">The Moth Tragedy</h5>
			<p class="card-text">Moths are beautiful zucchini plant killers.
				I spent most of last summer growing a single zucchini plant. By the
				end of August, we'd eaten a total of seven zucchinis. This year, I
				started the seedlings early, planted with plenty of room, and had a
				beautiful plant producing zucchini by June. Then, the moths came.
				They lay eggs near the plant. The larvae burrow inside the stems and
				eat from the center. Rememdies include injecting an insecticide with
				a hypodermic needle. I ended up cutting off most of the stems, and
				it's slowly regenerating. Moral of the story, BUY A MOTH NET!!</p>

			<h5 class="card-title">Beautiful Turnips</h5>
			<p class="card-text">The turnip crop this year is amazing. Supposedly a winter
			plant, I was nervous about planting the extra pack of these I found in the panty 
			(I should read a blog about organizing my pantry!). I planted them in my raised bed
			which is very handy to start seedlings in the winter, and they grew quickly. We love
			to eat them fried, they're spicy raw, and the most recent project included turnip soup. </p>
